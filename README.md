## Neural Network models for IonicLiquid property Predictions (ILNet)
Ionic Liquids are organic or inorganic paired ions that are liquid at or above room temperature. They are 'green solvents' or 'solvents of the future' due to their exceptional properties:
* Negligible vapor pressure
* High chemical ctability
* Wide liquid temperature range  
They are employed as electrolytes in redox flow batteries and solar cells, solvents and materials in pharmaceutical products.

This project explores the use of deep learning models to predict density, viscosity and heat capacity of ionic liquids. Further multi-task predictions are evaluated with the overlapping data sets and comparisons are drawn between single and multi-task predictions.
