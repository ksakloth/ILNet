## Neural Network models for IonicLiquid property Predictions (ILNet)
### Ionic Liquids are organic or inorganic paired ions that are liquid at or above room temperature. They are 'green solvents' or 'solvents of the future' due to their exceptional properties:
* Negligible vapor pressure
* High Chemical Stability
* Wide liquid temperature range
